summary: Two aircraft collided in mid-air near Delhi when a Kazakhstan Airlines flight descended into the path of a climbing Saudi Arabian Airlines 747, killing all 349 people aboard both planes.

## Collision in the Sky

On November 12, 1996, at approximately 6:40 PM local time, the skies above the small Indian town of Charkhi Dadri, about 100 kilometers west of Delhi, became the site of the world's deadliest mid-air collision. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 763, a Boeing 747, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907, an Ilyushin Il-76, killing all 349 people aboard both aircraft.

### Two Flights on Converging Paths

**Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 763** had departed Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi bound for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, with a final destination of Jeddah. The Boeing 747-100 carried 312 people: 289 passengers and 23 crew members. Captain Khowyter Habib Al-Shubaily commanded the aircraft, which was climbing through 14,000 feet on its assigned airway.

**Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907** was an Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo aircraft approaching Delhi from Chimkent, Kazakhstan. The four-engine freighter carried 27 passengers (mostly Kazakh nationals returning from a shopping trip to Delhi) and 10 crew members, for a total of 37 people. The aircraft was descending into Delhi, assigned to maintain 15,000 feet until further cleared by air traffic control.

### The Fatal Descent

As Saudi 763 climbed and Kazakhstan 1907 descended, both aircraft were operating in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) during twilight. The flights were on opposite, reciprocal headings on Airway G452/W45, a common corridor for traffic to and from Delhi.

Air traffic control had assigned clear altitudes: Saudi 763 was cleared to climb to 14,000 feet, while Kazakhstan 1907 was instructed to maintain 15,000 feet—providing a standard 1,000-foot vertical separation.

However, Kazakhstan 1907 did not maintain its assigned altitude. The Kazakh crew, experiencing communication difficulties due to limited English proficiency, descended below 15,000 feet. When the crew reported reaching and maintaining Flight Level 150 (15,000 feet), they were actually at approximately 14,500 feet and still descending.

### The Collision

At 6:40:41 PM, traveling at a combined closure rate of nearly 1,200 km/h, the two aircraft collided at approximately 14,000 feet. The Saudi 747's left wing sliced into the Kazakhstan Il-76's fuselage.

The violent impact sheared off the 747's wing and sent both aircraft into uncontrollable descents. Wreckage rained down over a wide area around Charkhi Dadri. There were no survivors from either aircraft. All 349 people perished, making it not only the deadliest mid-air collision in history but also the deadliest aviation accident in India's history and the deadliest aviation accident without survivors.

### Investigation Findings

The official investigation, conducted by Indian authorities, placed primary responsibility on the Kazakhstan Airlines crew. The final report identified several critical failures:

#### Primary Cause
**Failure to Maintain Assigned Altitude**: The Kazakhstan crew descended below their assigned altitude of 15,000 feet, entering the same airspace as the climbing Saudi aircraft.

#### Contributing Factors

**Language Barriers**: The Kazakh crew's poor English language skills severely hampered communication with air traffic control. Transcripts of radio communications showed repeated misunderstandings and requests for clarification.

**Crew Resource Management Failures**: The investigation identified three specific instances where the Kazakhstan crew failed to follow proper CRM procedures:
1. The captain did not properly monitor the first officer's flying
2. The crew did not cross-check altitude assignments and actual altitude
3. They did not verify their understanding of ATC instructions

**Lack of Secondary Surveillance Radar**: Indira Gandhi International Airport did not have Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR), which provides aircraft identification and altitude information by reading transponder signals. Controllers were relying solely on Primary Surveillance Radar, which shows aircraft position but not altitude or identity.

**Absence of TCAS**: Neither aircraft was equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), which would have provided automated warnings and resolution advisories to both crews about the impending collision.

### Aftermath and Safety Improvements

The Charkhi Dadri disaster exposed critical vulnerabilities in air traffic control systems and international aviation operations:

#### Immediate Changes in India

**Altitude Separation**: Indian authorities implemented a mandate requiring 2,000 feet of vertical separation (instead of the standard 1,000 feet) between aircraft traveling in opposite directions on the same airway near Delhi, effectively doubling the safety margin.

**Secondary Surveillance Radar**: Delhi upgraded its air traffic control systems to include SSR capability, providing controllers with altitude and identification information.

**Airspace Restructuring**: India reorganized airspace around Delhi to reduce the complexity of traffic flows and minimize the risk of similar conflicts.

#### Global Impact

**TCAS Mandates Accelerated**: The accident provided additional impetus for the worldwide adoption of Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS). Many countries accelerated their timelines for requiring TCAS installation on commercial aircraft.

**English Language Proficiency**: The disaster highlighted the critical importance of English language proficiency in international aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) subsequently strengthened language proficiency requirements for pilots and air traffic controllers operating in international airspace.

**Training Requirements**: Airlines and aviation authorities enhanced CRM training, with particular emphasis on altitude awareness, altitude verification procedures, and the importance of questioning instructions that seem incorrect.

### A Preventable Tragedy

The Charkhi Dadri collision was entirely preventable. If any of several safety barriers had functioned properly, 349 people would not have died:

- If the Kazakhstan crew had maintained their assigned altitude
- If the crew had properly understood and confirmed ATC instructions
- If Delhi had possessed SSR to alert controllers of the altitude deviation
- If either aircraft had been equipped with TCAS
- If the captain had properly monitored the first officer's flying

This redundancy of failures—the "Swiss cheese model" where multiple holes in safety layers aligned—led to catastrophe.

### Legacy

The Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision remains the deadliest mid-air collision in history and the worst aviation disaster to occur in India. The crash site became a grim scene where investigators worked to identify remains and piece together the wreckage of two aircraft from different corners of the world.

For families of the victims, the disaster was compounded by the preventable nature of the accident. The knowledge that simple adherence to assigned altitudes, clear communication, and available technology could have prevented the collision made the loss even more difficult to bear.

The disaster serves as a stark reminder that aviation safety depends on multiple layers of protection. International operations require clear communication, proper training, adequate technology, and unwavering adherence to procedures. When these safeguards fail, the consequences can be catastrophic.

Today, thanks in part to lessons learned from Charkhi Dadri, mid-air collisions have become exceedingly rare. TCAS is now mandatory on most commercial aircraft worldwide, English proficiency standards are enforced internationally, and air traffic control systems have been modernized. The 349 victims of Charkhi Dadri did not die in vain—their tragedy drove improvements that save lives today.
